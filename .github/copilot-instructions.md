# HTML Page Game Development - AI Agent Instructions

## Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of single-page HTML5 educational games and interactive web applications, primarily designed for the Keepwork platform. All games are self-contained HTML files with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Single-File Structure
- **Every game is a standalone `.html` file** - no external CSS/JS files (except CDN libraries)
- Games are organized by type: educational activities, character AI, mini-games, contests
- Obsolete files are moved to `old_obsoleted_files/` directory

### Standard Technology Stack
1. **Tailwind CSS**: Always use CDN version for styling
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.keepwork.com/keepwork/cdn/tailwindcss@3.4.16.js"></script>
   ```
2. **No custom CSS/font files** - Use only Tailwind utility classes and inline styles
3. **Three.js** (when needed): Use CDN for 3D games like `guess_cubes.html`
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdnproxy.keepwork.com/jsdelivr/npm/three@0.128.0/build/three.min.js"></script>
   ```

### UI/UX Design Patterns

#### Landscape-First Layout
- Design for landscape orientation without requiring scroll by default
- Use viewport height units (`vh`) and flexbox for responsive full-screen layouts
- See `typing_game.html` for responsive stats panel implementation

#### Common UI Components
- **Rules Modal**: Initial popup showing game instructions with "Start Game" button
  - Example in `guess_cubes.html` lines 308-332
  - Typically hidden after first interaction, with floating help button (‚ùì) to reopen
- **Stats Display**: Real-time scoring/progress indicators in fixed corners
  - Left side: Level info, cube counts, game state
  - Right side: Controls, difficulty selector, action buttons
- **Success Effects**: Centered overlay messages using `#successEffect` pattern with fade animations

#### Mobile Responsiveness
- Use `@media (max-width: 768px)` breakpoints
- Switch from fixed positioning to flexbox layouts on small screens

### JavaScript Patterns

#### No DOMContentLoaded
- **Start game logic at the end of script tags** - do not wrap in `DOMContentLoaded`
- Initialize immediately after DOM is parsed

#### Event-Driven Architecture
All games implement a parent-child messaging system with `postMessage`:

```javascript
// Standard message types to handle:
window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  switch(e.data.type) {
    case 'setGameConfig':      // Receive markdown/JSON config from parent
    case 'getGameStats':       // Return current score/difficulty
    case 'gameContinue':       // Handle restart/challenge actions
  }
});

// Standard events to send to parent:
window.parent.postMessage({ type: 'gameLoaded' }, '*');
window.parent.postMessage({ type: 'gameStarted' }, '*');
window.parent.postMessage({ 
  type: 'gameFinished', 
  data: { earnedPoints, wpm, accuracy, difficulty } 
}, '*');
```

#### Game State Management
- Track `gameStarted` flag globally to send `gameLoaded` only once
- Store high scores in `localStorage` (e.g., `bestScore`, `highestScore`)
- Use level-based progression system (see `typing_game.html` lines 756-840)

### Keepwork SDK Integration

When games need server-side features (data storage, TTS, LLM chat), include:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.keepwork.com/sdk/keepworkSDK.iife.js"></script>
```

Initialize the SDK:
```javascript
const sdk = new KeepworkSDK({
  timeout: 30000
});
console.log(`Keepwork SDK initialized token: ${sdk.token}`);
```

**SDK Features Used:**
- Text-to-speech services
- LLM chatbot integration (see `characterAI.html`)
- User data persistence
- Authentication via URL token parameter: `?token=eyJhbGci...`

### Internationalization (i18n)

Games support multi-language via embedded translation objects:

```javascript
const translations = {
  zhCN: { /* Chinese text */ },
  enUS: { /* English text */ }
};

// Detect language from URL param or browser
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const langParam = urlParams.get('lang'); // ?lang=zhCN or ?lang=enUS
const currentLanguage = langParam || (navigator.language.startsWith('zh') ? 'zhCN' : 'enUS');

// Apply with data-i18n attributes
<div data-i18n="ui.buttons.newGame">üéÆ ÈáçÊñ∞ÂºÄÂßã</div>
```

See `guess_cubes.html` lines 592-692 for complete implementation.

### Game Scoring System

Standard scoring pattern across games:
- **100-point scale**: Total score normalized to 100 regardless of levels
- **Efficiency-based**: `baseScore * (minRequired / actualUsed)`
- **Level progression**: Divide 100 by total levels for per-level scoring
- **Persistent high scores**: Always track `bestScore` in localStorage

```javascript
function calculateGameScore(gridSize, actualCubes, minCubes, maxLevels = 10) {
  const baseScore = 100 / maxLevels;
  const efficiency = Math.min(1, minCubes / actualCubes);
  return Math.round(baseScore * efficiency);
}
```

## Development Workflow

### Creating New Games
1. Copy structure from similar game in root directory
2. Use Tailwind CDN - never create separate CSS files
3. Implement standard message handlers for parent integration
4. Add rules modal with floating help button
5. Test landscape layout without scrolling

### Editing Existing Games
- **Make small, incremental edits** - don't regenerate entire files
- Preserve existing game logic and state management
- Maintain backward compatibility with parent window messaging


## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå Don't use external CSS/font files  
‚ùå Don't wrap initialization in DOMContentLoaded  
‚ùå Don't create multi-file projects  
‚ùå Don't ignore mobile responsiveness  
‚ùå Don't forget parent window messaging protocol  

‚úÖ Do use Tailwind CDN for all styling  
‚úÖ Do start game logic at end of script tag  
‚úÖ Do keep everything in single HTML file  
‚úÖ Do design for landscape-first  
‚úÖ Do implement standard postMessage handlers
